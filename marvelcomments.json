 {"c_id":"091910ba", "user":"kbi_kbi", "c_text":"Excellent game that has only one weak point - limited vocabulary. During one weekend  in nice company we went over all pack of cards two or three times and already begun to guess correctly not because of good explanation, but because it was explained in a similar way before. As soon as they start releasing additional word packs for it, I'll change my rating to 10."}
